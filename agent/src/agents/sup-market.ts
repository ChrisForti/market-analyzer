  query: `You are Jimmy, researching the 2026 global and regional market for HIGH-END ARTISAN watercraft.

PRIMARY FOCUS - "THE PADDLEBOARD PHASE":
Scan for wood-constructed Stand-Up Paddleboards. Ignore inflatables and foam-core mass production. Research:

1. SHAPE & PERFORMANCE: Are 'Touring' and 'Displacement' hulls outperforming 'All-Around'? What lengths are trending (12'6" vs 14")?
2. AESTHETIC MATERIALITY: What wood combinations are viral in the luxury segment? (Western Red Cedar, Dark Walnut stringers, Paulownia)
3. LUXURY FEATURE GAPS: Are customers demanding integrated tech (GPS mounts), specialized fin setups, or "Eco-Luxe" bio-resin finishes?
4. PRICE CEILING: What are boutique, hand-built hollow wooden boards selling for?

SECONDARY FOCUS - CUSTOM CRAFT EXPANSION:
Identify "Build Gaps" where artisan woodworking is a competitive advantage:
- Hollow Wooden Surfboards (Longboard/Mid-length segments)
- Cedar-Strip Canoes & Kayaks (Solo Pack Boats, Expedition Kayaks, classic Prospector shapes)
- Technical Accessories (wooden paddles, CNC-machined fin boxes, decorative inlays)

OUR SHOP CAPABILITIES (use these as constraints):
- Hand-Build Mastery: Zero size limits for cedar-strip or hollow-wood projects
- CNC Precision: 3018 Pro (300mm x 400mm) for custom parts, placards, hardware, inlays
- Material Access: Marine Hardwoods (Teak, Mahogany, Walnut), Acrylics, King StarBoard
